# Learning C# Networking API

Most modern games and web applications uses network programming.  This is a good starting point to learn how to do it in C#.

If you are interested in game development, you might want to learn TCP and UDP implementations using C#.

If you are interested in web development, you might want to learn HTTP in c# although .Net provides everything you need to build a web server it is always good to understand how the underlying protocols work.

This is also good start if you are interested in Network Security, Network connections are the backbone of any secure application. Learning how to send and receive data securely is a crucial skill to have.

These are examples of how to use the C# networking API to create a simple HTTP server and client, a TCP chat server, and a UDP echo server.
